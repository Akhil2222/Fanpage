    <h1>ANARCHY FANS</h1>
    
        <p>Welcome to my stanpage. </p>
        <p>Here you can find some information about my favorite game <strong>Anarchy</strong>.</p>
        <p>It's a free online browser game that allows you to be whatever civiliation you want. Want to be a mercenary? Done. Want to become like Saudi Arabia and control the world's oil? Done! Want to be the leader of the top alliance in the Server? Your wish. You have to work to get what you want, and the game is very similar to real politics.</p>
        <p>Als, the sprites look funny</p>
